#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
It is important in that it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of Programming Languages (1950s-1960s): Involved languages like C and Fotran that were important in the conversiom of machine-level coding to human-readable code
2. Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s): Invilved the dedication to treating software development as an engineering discipline, emphasizing planning, design, and management.
3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s): Agile methodologies emerged as a response to the rigidity of traditional software development processes like the Waterfall model.
   
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and recording requirements of the users and the requirements of the system.
Design: Creating strategic and tactical guidelines of the software’s design and layout.
Implementation: Implementing the design and developing the software and writing the code as per the design architecture.
Testing: Conducting different checks in order to determine the quality of the software and whether or not it has met the intended functionality that is required of it.
Deployment: Transferring of the software to the users or consumers.
Maintenance: Continuing with the support, updates and enhancements of the software after its implementation.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirement, desing and implementation while Agile is an iterative and incremental approach on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall methodology can be used in projects with clear, unchanging requirements like construction pf software with specifications are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Agile methodology can be used in projects with elvolving requiremants such as startup products.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Deals with the writing of code and the implementation of software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Responsible for the quality of the developed software by coming up with test plans.
Project Manager: Responsible for the management of the software project, including planning, implementation and delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Integrated development environments which contain all the tools that are necessary for writing, debugging, and testing of code for example; Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Version control systems and other tools that help in organizing the work of the team and managing source codes for example; Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies involve: Effective communication.
                    Agile methodologies.
                    Prioritization of tasks.
                    Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the process of creating and fine-tuning certain queries that lead the AI models to produce the required responses or outcomes. It refers to the ability to optimise the input text in terms of the words used, the syntax and the content to produce the best and most relevant results from the AI.
It is important in improving the accuracy and relevance of the responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "How does weather affect people"
Improved Prompt: "Describe how extreme weather events, like hurricanes or heatwaves, impact public health and infrastructure in urban areas."

Why It's More Effective: The enhanced prompt is better because it outlines the nature and extent of the question with clarity. It directs the AI’s attention to the key, tangible events like hurricanes and heatwaves and their effects on public health and infrastructure of cities. This specificity also guarantees that the response is not only pertinent but also enlightening, presenting the precise information that the user requires.
